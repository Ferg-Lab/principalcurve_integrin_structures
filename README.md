Prediction of full-length all-atom structures of $\alpha_{IIb}\beta_{3}$ integrin along its minimum free energy activation pathway
---

This repository contains the data, codes, and analysis scripts for finding structures along a minimum free energy pathway connecting the inactive and active conformational states of $\alpha_{IIb}\beta_{3}$ integrin using finite temperature string method. For methodological details on the structures generated along the initial guess string, please refer to the follwing repo: https://github.com/Ferg-Lab/integrin_molgen.git.
